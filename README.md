# RISC-V-Reference-SoC-Tapeout-Program
This 20-week program guides students, educators, and professionals through end-to-end RISC-V SoC design and fabrication using Synopsys tools and the SCL180 PDK. Part of Indiaâ€™s Semiconductor Mission, it offers hands-on RTL-to-silicon training, with execution at IIT Gandhinagar, creating a reusable, national framework for academic chip tapeouts.
